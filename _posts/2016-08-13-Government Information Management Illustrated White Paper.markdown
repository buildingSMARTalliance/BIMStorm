White House 21st Century Digital Strategy               

SEPS2BIM initiative mirrors White House Strategy

### Executive Summary:

The National Institute of Building Science’s buildingSMART alliance Thought Leadership has assessed and compared the White House 21st Century Digital Strategy and the SEPS2BIM initiative, which is a unified effort of the Department of Defense Defense Health Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of the Navy and the Office of Management and Budget. The National Institute of Building Sciences and contracted consultants supported the SEPS2BIM initiative, which aligns information about spaces and equipment and visualizes the data in web-based Building Information Models.

Thought Leadership, which includes government employees, association executives, business owners and employees of leading private companies, have unanimously (?) determined that the SEPS2BIM digital strategy is in alignment with the White House 21st Century Digital Strategy. The SEPS2BIM approach is flexible and therefore is suitable for customization and adoption by all Federal Agencies, State Government and Local Government. It is also suitable for all facility asset owners who want to improve efficiency and effectiveness by sharing data on mobile devices using proven, secure web services.

The Government Information Management Illustrated White Paper provides an overview of how to gain dramatic benefits from sharing data on mobile devices using proven secure, web services.

### Existing Conditions

Business processes that result in our built environment are entrenched in Industrial Age policies, strategies and tactical approaches.

Information Age policies, strategies and tactical approaches are required for success at this time, August, 2016.

On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama signed an executive order making open and machine readable data the new default for government information. This 21st Century Digital Strategy calls for focus on information as an asset that can be securely shared on the web for use on mobile devices or desktop computers. This Strategy allows Government entities to gain benefits already being enjoyed by private industry. 

The Strategy results from a policy calling for decoupling of data (1) from software applications (3) using secure web services (2) to avoid creation of “Black Boxes.” Black Boxes are entrenched software platforms that do not easily share data with other software and keep information owners in one program. 

Decoupling data from one software program and letting many people access data using a transformative number of software programs can result in mission success levels previously thought unattainable – as is demonstrated in private industry on a consistent basis.

Private industry is using proven, repeatable processes to provide improvements in effectiveness and efficiency that are transforming their mission success. 

Funded by the Federal Government, the SEPS2BIM initiative shows one way any government entity, institution or private company can use secure, web-based information on mobile devices to improve visual certainty regarding complex conditions to dramatically improve consensus decision making.

The Space Equipment Planning System (SEPS) was developed by the Department of Navy’s SPAWAR to assist the Department of Defense Defense Health Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The original SEPS is a spreadsheet system used to coordinate information about health care space and equipment planning for new projects or renovation projects.

SEPS2BIM uses the information in the spreadsheets to create virtual Building Information Models (BIM) represented on geographically realistic websites, such as Google Earth.

The SEPS2BIM initiative was proven successful in less than two years because it leveraged an existing two-step data authentication system established by the Office of Management and used by almost all Federal Agencies. The MAX.gov system was developed to improve secure identification of all Federal staff to allow web-based communication and data sharing. Approval times were reduced from about 6 months to about 15 minutes. 

Using the proven MAX.gov system secures authentic information about real property assets and personal property assets in real time. 

 

The Asset Leadership Network awarded the SEPS2BIM initiative and it’s “parent” initiative, FED iFM, a 2015 Asset Leadership Impact Award for Federal Agency Collaboration. See the award statement at:  _________________

Using web-based processes that are new to professionals addressing the built environment does not mean eliminating existing, proven processes. Newer processes are, however, going to reduce the volume of traditional processes.

 
### Existing Standards and Regulations

From a tactical point of view, it is good to start with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A-119 states that Federal Agencies must use public consensus based standards already adopted instead of creating their own standard.

The ISO 55000 family of asset management standards is the only international, consensus based asset management standard.

ISO 55001 section 7.5, Information Management, can be written in a manner that allows all participating agencies, departments, divisions, suppliers and consultants to share real property asset information and personal property asset information in a secure and standardized manner.

Sharing of real property data and personal property data in a secure and standardized manner on web-based, mobile devices can provide repeatable benefits across large portfolios.


The building industry is making great strides with standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Construction to Operation Building information exchange (COBie). But when the information in IFC or COBie formats can be securely shared in many programs on many web-based mobile devices, they are dramatically more effective.

When consistent structured data is the primary requirement, other standards, such as IFC and COBie can be more effective.

Effective existing standards and regulations about data include the World Wide Web www.w3.org and ___________

### Proven Practices

For vendor-neutral government entities, decoupling data from software programs enables interoperability that improves effectiveness and efficiency.

It is a goal of a vendor-neutral owner to ensure that the data can be used by any tool so as not to limit partners in their internal work processes.  


Decoupling data from single software programs for sharing on web-based devices also allows asset owners to more readily own their data. When data is locked in one software program there is a limit to innovative improvements that can be realized by the growing number of technical innovators.

Using SEPS2BIM as a standard way of managing information about spaces and equipment allows the owner to define processes based on business needs, as well as defining the standard for information transfer.  This frees owners from 'life long' commitments to specific software vendors and opens the data for effective use by a larger pool of potential product and service providers.  

Establishing policies that support asset owners taking ownership of their information is highly successful in the Information Age. When asset owners take ownership of their information, they are more agile in adopting cost-saving and time-saving business processes. 

A basis for Systems Engineering is to make data correct and consistent as a starting point. Starting with structured data is a flexible approach that can be tailored for the needs of specific stakeholders.  This empowers owners to seek out the streamlined technologies that best serve their business practices and the needs of their stakeholder communities.

SEPS2BIM allows one way to do this. 

MAX.gov provides a,b,c (engage Shahid to help write a few short sentences.)


As part of the SEPS2BIM initiative, there was a practical exploration of how secure, web-based data could impact work order effectiveness and efficiency. It was estimated that the DoD and VA could save more than $100 million could be saved by simply reducing the need to walk back to a desktop computer to enter data about a work order.

### Recommendations

The policies that lead to the development of SEPS2BIM can be adopted as a standard way to address asset Information Management as required in ISO 55001- 7.5.

Making a standard for secure, web-based data sharing regarding real property data and personal property data will allow Federal Agencies to leverage the Office of Management Budget’s A 119(?) policy that requires use of existing standards.

In order to advance policies based on SEPS2BIM, it is good to have three things:
 
- Procurement/purchase Intent policy from one or more buyers to indicate that vendors who accept and promote the policies can be rewarded in the marketplace; 
- Business Initiative Interoperability strategies that show the way buyers will allow vendors to invest in research and development based on a specific opportunity path; and,
- Enhanced Developer Experience that allows software developers to immediately use data to quickly demonstrate advanced, secure business processes.

Executive Office staff and Legislators can be confident in approving language that allows sharing secure asset information on web-based mobile devices to allow dramatic savings in time and money related to planning, designing, constructing, operating and managing our built environment.  

Making data secure and open means greater transparency, which is a benefit for owners, but it also means that the designers have to adjust their work processes for each owner, depending on how the owner had the data structured.  (Of course, right now, we have the reverse problem where owners have to adjust business processes for different assets depending on which firm/tool/technology has worked on the building data.) However, the Federal Government can adopt a single, secure, open data structure for real property asset information and personal property asset information, an industry standard approach can emerge. 

Since the SEPS2BIM initiative follows the White House 21st Century Digital Strategy, it is a worthwhile candidate for setting a Federal standard on space and equipment information management.

It is important remember that technology is not the solution by itself. Technology is a tool or set of tools that teams use to address needs that should be driven by sound policy, strategy, tactics, management and business practices. But the technology needs to be adaptable and easily shared with a diverse range of stakeholders to achieve the most effective and efficient mission success.
