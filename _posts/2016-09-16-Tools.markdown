A list of tools being used and developed for the BIMStorm.


### BIMStorm Open Source Projects
BIMStorm and the buildingSMARTalliance are protyping open source projects for the buidling industry.

* [BIMplan GeoJSON Concept](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm/blob/gh-pages/_files/BIMStorm%20Data%20Independence%20BIM%20Plan%20Viewer.jpg)
* [BIMplan GeoJSON Live Viewer for BIM GIS FM](https://bim-genie.com/static/planview/portfolio.html?sysID=177)
* [BIMplan GitHUB Source Code](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMplan)
* [buildingSMARTalliance Prototype for Rapid Standards Development and Documentation](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance)
* [BIMCloud](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm/blob/gh-pages/_files/BIMStorm%20Data%20Independence%20BIM%20Cloud.jpg) is a server of BIM data used in the BIMStorm.
* [BIM Asset Tracking App](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm/blob/gh-pages/_files/Asset%20Tracking.088.jpg) Using the BIM Cloud a protytpe app was developed for tracking assets and updating data.

### Collaboration Tools

* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/b3bNRClj/bimstorm-data-independence) - Online bulletin board like tool to view and post information. 
* [GitHub](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm) - Collaborting on everything from documentation creation to code development. 
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BIMStorm) - Messages about BIMStorm

### Owner Program Requirements
* [SEPS2BIM](http://SEPS2BIM.org) - The Space and Equipment Planning System (SEPS) is a Department of Defense - Defense Health Agency and Department of Veterans Affairs developed and maintained tool for managing program crteria for projects and generating program for design and room contents that are used by the design team. SEPS2BIM is a series of tools with live links to SEPS data that then automatically generates the equivalent BIMs.
* [Program2BIM](http://program2BIM.com) Using SEPS2BIM as a starting point, BIMStorm is identifying how program and space requirements are universal can can be used by other owners.

### Standards Open Source and More
 * [COBie](http://wbdg.org/resources/cobie.php) buidlingSMART standard for structuring data for facility operations.
 * [iFM - Integrated Facility Management](http://FEDifm.org) Prototypical standard developed for a group of facility owners in a National Institute of Building Sciences project based on COBie with extented functionality to cover facility portfolios.
  * [More info on iFM and FEDiFM](http://FEDifm.org)
  * [iFM Data Dictionary](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm/blob/gh-pages/_files/Data%20Dictionary%20FED%20iFM-4Jan2016.xlsx)
  * [iFM ERD](https://github.com/buildingSMARTalliance/BIMStorm/blob/gh-pages/_files/ERD%20FED%20iFM%2011Jan2016.pdf)
 * [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. BIMStorm is inserting BIM data into GeoJSON and exploring extensions that may be needed to support BIM data.
 * [Web2Py](http://www.web2py.com/)Free open source full-stack framework for rapid development of fast, scalable, secure and portable database-driven web-based applications. Written and programmable in Python. Used to parse tabular data into BIM Cloud.
 * [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) SQLite is a high-reliability, embedded, zero-configuration, public-domain, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world.
